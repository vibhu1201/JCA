				<p class="process-description">Are you going through chemotherapy or is your hair loss natural or from other medical reasons? If you are going through chemotherapy, then finding the right hair alternative becomes a more time sensitive issue.</br></br>Once you have started your treatment, you have between 17 - 21 days before your hair begins to release. That is why seeing you is so important. It is optimal for us to set the initial consult before you begin losing your hair. This gives us a chance to see your length, color, density and best determine which product will best fit you. Some patients find us after their hair has released, we then work with photos for color and length and your determination on the thickness or density.</br></br>When your hair begins to release, or slightly before, we can make an appointment to take your hair down. (This all depends on how you are feeling) We will then start the fitting, sizing, cutting and styling of your new hair. We generally book about 3 hours for this process.</br></br>At the time of completion, you will receive a complete list of instructions and reference sheets for all that we have just gone over. This will include: shampooing, conditioning, styling (do's & don'ts), and maintenance.</br></br>Remember, you can call us at anytime with questions or if you are in need of help with your hair.</p>
