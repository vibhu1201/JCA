The years of service he has provided his clients has developed into some very strong relationships.</br></br>Many close family and friends had experienced various types of cancer, but John never knew how to help until he discovered the alternative hair business. His passion for the wig business stems from the solace women find when they realize there is a solution for their hair loss due to cancer treatment, trichotillomania or alopecia.</br></br>His innate ability to provide love, support and humor throughout this process is why many of his clients have commented that he has made a difficult experience easier than they ever imagined.</p>

					<p class="quote">"From shaving my head on that fateful day, to cutting the wig for three straight visits, John gave me more than a great looking wig, he offered kindness, compassion and understanding when I needed it the most."</p>
					<p class="person"><b>~ Odessa, Rush University</b></p>
					<p class="quote">"He helped me to find a great wig, and styled it to look so similar to my real hair that most people didn’t know I was undergoing chemotherapy. His positive attitude helped me through that stressful time."</p>

					<p class="quote">"I knew I didn’t have to worry about my hair. His 100% attention and care he gave to me, boosted my confidence immediately. I was then able to concentrate on getting better."</p>
					<p class="person"><b>~ Lisa, Northwestern University</b></p>
					<p class="quote">"John suggested that I try a fall. The challenge with a fall is that the texture and color have to perfectly blend with your own hair. My hair looks better now than it has in years! This work is John’s passion; he understands what you are going through and cares how you feel. His goal is to help you look your best and retain your self-confidence."</p>
