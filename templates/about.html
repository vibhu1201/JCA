					<p class="john">Over the past 30 years in Chicago, John has worked in the salon industry as a salon owner, hairdresser and educator. With a belief in continuous education, he stays current with styles & trends and only works with the very best wig products the industry has to offer.</br></br>John began his journey some years ago when the daughter of a friend was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of two. A few years later, his best friend John N. was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. John worked with John N. through repeated transitions of hair loss, head shaving and re-growth for five years.</br></br>Since then, John has specialized in hair care for women experiencing hair loss as a result of medical conditions or the side effects of medical treatments. He is actively involved with the American Cancer Society's "Look Good Feel Better" program and also works with the Mobile Salon program run by the Breast Cancer Network of Strength (formerly Y-Me). The Mobil Salon serves breast cancer patients wherever they are being treated, making it easier for them to obtain wigs, prostheses and other items.</br></br>John’s innate ability to provide love, support and humor throughout this process is why many of his clients have commented that he has made a difficult experience easier than they ever imagined. It’s one of the many gifts that he brings to this business. John makes a difficult transition more comfortable due to his knowledge, his heart and his understanding.</p>

					<p class="quote">"From shaving my head on that fateful day, to cutting the wig for three straight visits, John gave me more than a great looking wig, he offered kindness, compassion and understanding when I needed it the most."</p>
					<p class="person"><b>~ Odessa, Rush University</b></p>
					<p class="quote">"He helped me to find a great wig, and styled it to look so similar to my real hair that most people didn’t know I was undergoing chemotherapy. His positive attitude helped me through that stressful time."</p>

					<p class="quote">"I knew I didn’t have to worry about my hair. His 100% attention and care he gave to me, boosted my confidence immediately. I was then able to concentrate on getting better."</p>
					<p class="person"><b>~ Lisa, Northwestern University</b></p>
					<p class="quote">"John suggested that I try a fall. The challenge with a fall is that the texture and color have to perfectly blend with your own hair. My hair looks better now than it has in years! This work is John’s passion; he understands what you are going through and cares how you feel. His goal is to help you look your best and retain your self-confidence."</p>

					<p class="question"><b>What kind of wig should I get?</b></p>
					<p class= "answer">Although there are only 2 options, human or synthetic hair, there are numerous choices.</p>
					<p class="question"><b>What kind of choices do I have?</b></p>
					<p class= "answer">Choices range from synthetic hair wigs (short length, machine-made) to European human hair wigs (long length, hand-tied, lace-front), from light blond to dark black. The colors come highlighted, low lighted or root color. Hair texture ranges from Anglo European to ethnic.</p>
					<p class="question"><b>Are wigs usually covered by insurance?</b></p>
					<p class="answer">Although many insurance companies do not cover this expense, there are some carriers who may provide partial coverage (ask your doctor for a prescription for a “cranial prosthesis”). You will need to contact your insurance carrier to verify coverage under your policy. However, we are confident we can work within any budget.</p>

					<p class="answer">One of the things we will talk about during our consultation is your current styling habits. We then make a hairstyle choice that best suits your needs.</p>
					<p class="question"><b>Are there special products I need to get? Where will I find them & how much will those cost?</b></p>
					<p class="answer">Great news! Not only will we make sure you have a strong working knowledge of your products, we also provide a copy of detailed instructions for easy reference. More great news: you do not need to worry about finding our preferred line of hair care products. When you purchase one of our wigs, we include a complete starter kit at no additional charge.</p>

					<p class="question"><b>What is your Refund Policy?</b></p>
					<p class="answer">We begin with a complimentary 2 to 3 hour initial consultation that provides our customers with a clear understanding of J. Crager Alternatives products and services. Part of this consultation covers our refund policy.</br></br><span class="underline">Non-Customized Wigs:</span> A full refund is offered on wigs that have not been cut, colored, resized or altered in any way.</br></br><span class="underline">Customized or Altered Wigs:</span> We have a no return/no refund policy on custom wig orders, or any wig that has been cut, colored, resized or altered in any fashion. J. Crager Alternatives works with each customer to ensure the wig is cut, sized, and colored to their satisfaction. Part of the styling and sizing process includes in-depth product care and maintenance education. Without proper care and maintenance, the quality of any product will be short lived.</br></br><span class="underline">At J. Crager Alternatives, our goal is to ensure you are fully informed and your transition is as easy and comfortable as possible.</span></p>
